- âš¡ I a passionated and happy programmer ^_^
- âš¡ Life is to short to waste it being unhappy, just laught because you are still alive doing nice and clean code!
- âš¡ Nowadays I am hardly focused on my personal growth through the creation of better software solutions in Ionic salted with React + TypeStript

- ğŸ˜„ Multiplatform: I Love it!
  - IONIC + React + TypeScript: I'm was exercising really hard!!
   
- ğŸ˜„ PHP: I love this lang and I been doing well with it for many years. I'm agree and desire to use Frameworks, because I'm faithfull about the hability to get better practices over the developments and teams, being easier be happy working over the pressure of a project.
  - I believe in Laravel and Symphony, also in some other small like Slim, Lumen or CakePHP for some purposes.
  - I love the best practices and the clean code, and it is nice to have something to enjoy in this world!

- ğŸ˜„ Javascript: I was using javascript in all my projects, but never before I was focused in the use of javascript for extensive use and getting it as the absolute unique language required to success. Then, today I'm doing it as a must, gropwing daily inm this purposes.
  - REACT:  I'm exercising hard. I created by my own a Mapbox routes editor and an Ionic React wit TypeScript App, also som toys, nothing interesting enough.
  - VUE: A little bit, thank you. IS intuitive, if you have other lines of code near, obviously you will find.
  - JQuery: bye bye o.o also bye bye vanilla js....

- ğŸ˜„ Perseverance:
  - I have a big amount off perseverance, by familiar inheritance
  - Smarter after an infinite scroll of errors during development process, including daily, just trying to do the best.

- ğŸ˜„ Life:  Life
  - Life is the most important tech. Then, safe the planet and make the best to everybody. Fight for a better world!

### ğŸŒ± Bio-tech!!!
- ğŸŒ± I began on tech when I was a child opening brooken old devices to understand and fix it...
- ğŸŒ± Some people came to my home, who knows why, to ask me help to repair some devices xD o.o
- ğŸŒ± I knew about programming and so but... For me that was like something arcane and betwen the magic and misterious...
- ğŸŒ± Not was since I saw Matrix when I understood my destiny: the programming world!
- ğŸŒ± In my city, soft tech came from nothing to a huge network of jobs and opportunities, and I got the loop.
- ğŸ˜„ To this day I'm growing and learning all the time without rest zZzZ haha
- âš¡ I have no life and certainly you know it ^^! Truth?
- âš¡ Help! :D

### Kind regards
##3 And just let me programm being happy, then magic features will born!
