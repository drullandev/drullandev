### ğŸŒ± Bio-tech!!!
- ğŸŒ± I began on tech when I was a child opening brooken old devices to understand and fix it...
- ğŸŒ± Some people came to my home, who knows why, to ask me help to repair some devices xD o.o
- ğŸŒ± I knew about programming and so but... For me that was like something arcane and betwen the magic and misterious...
- ğŸŒ± Not was since I saw Matrix when I understood my destiny: the programming world!
- ğŸŒ± In my city, soft tech came from nothing to a huge network of jobs and opportunities, and I got the loop.
- ğŸ˜„ To this day I'm growing and learning all the time without rest zZzZ haha
- âš¡ I have no life and certainly you know it ^^! Truth?

### Kind regards
##3 And just let me programm being happy, then magic features will born!
